# RA_DownloadAllBadges
[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php) script that adds "download all badges" button to every game page on [RetroAchievements.org](https://retroachievements.org/)

- For correct ordering use default or "Normal ^" sorting of achievements.
- Images are placed in a subfolder named after the game inside the default download directory.
- Images are renamed as "X - Name of the achievement"
